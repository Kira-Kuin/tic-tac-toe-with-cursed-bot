# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Cursed Bot

## What is This Project

in this project i tried to implement the `minimax` algorithm to find the best place for O to play so that its imposible to win **thats why i called him a cursed bot**, the project uses react 18.3.1 with no additional packages

i have learned the concept of `minimax` algorithm using [this short video](https://youtu.be/5y2a0Zhgq0U?si=56Cy_NSyueFuH_iv) that you can find in youtube

## What is the minimax algorithm

minimax is a decisions-making algorithm meaning that it finds the best next place to play to maximize the chances of winning (or tie if its imposible to make winning move)

### how does it works

for better understanding i highly recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/5y2a0Zhgq0U?si=56Cy_NSyueFuH_iv) but i will explain it bravely

the algorithm simply brute force into the game and finds the best score it can get ,if x wins the score gets -1, if tie gets 0 if wins gets 1, (values can be manipulated as you want)

the result is not -1 or 0 or 1, its a number defining the score or making that move (the higher is better)
